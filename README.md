# Lending Club Case Study
> We are working for Lending club a finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicantâ€™s profile.


## General Information
- The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan defaulters (loan_status = 'Charged Off'), i.e. the variables which are strong indicators. The company can use this knowledge for its risk assessment.
- loan.csv was the data set used for this.


## Conclusions
The below are the conclusions:
1. Higher the interest higher the Charge off ratio.
2. Higher the DTI ( debt to income ratio) will lead to higher charged off rate.
3. High income individuals has high repayment rate.
4. High and higher the income, higher the repayment.
